The purpose of this project is to show the implementation of the ASCON lightweight cryptographic algorithm on the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, to enable safe communication in situations
with limited resources. The ASCON method exhibits effective encryption and decryption procedures while guaranteeing strong cryptographic security thanks to rigorous algorithmic, code,
memory, and power optimizations. The feasibility of implementing lightweight cryptographic solutions on embedded devices such as the Raspberry Pi is demonstrated by a performance study,
which shows low encryption and decryption times along with optimum power usage. With possible applications in the Internet of Things, automotive industry, and other fields requiring
secure communication, the successful implementation offers up new research opportunities in lightweight cryptography and embedded systems.
